# NodeJS
This repository contains Nodejs codes.

In the above code, the Evaluation class is defined with a constructor that takes in two parameters: experience and skills. The evaluateExperience method simply logs the years of experience to the console. The evaluateSkills method iterates over the skills array and logs each skill with a corresponding index number.

You can create an instance of the Evaluation class with your own experience and skills, and then call the evaluateExperience and evaluateSkills methods to display the evaluation details.
